### 100 Days of GenAI

This repository is the content of 100 days of generative AI work.
Following is the content information of each day of the work.

## Day-01

Objective: Implement a encoder and decoder.  
Evaluation: Take input image, convert the image to latent representation, convert the latent represention back to original image. The original image and the retrieved image should be exactly same.

## Day-02

Manually implemented the attention module for single head and multihead Attention

## Day-03

Implementing Weiner Process via EulerMaruyama method for SDE simulation

## Day-04

Lab One: Simulate (O)SDEs to sample via Euler and EulerMaruyama Method.  
Lab Two: Simulation of conditional and marginal probability paths, vector field and score functions. (O)SDE are top level constructs which internally use these parameters to simulate the flow or diffusion.  
Lab Three: MLP to go from any initial distribution to target distribution using linear and gaussian conditional probability paths and vector fields. Also developed unet to go from gaussian distribution to MNIST data distribution

Number of creative ways to plot

## Day-05

UNet model trained on MNIST dataset to go from gaussian distribution to data distribution 

## Day-06 

Transformer based implementation of the diffusion
